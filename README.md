# natural-language-processing-twitter-dataset

Sentiment Analysis on tweets using Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK) package, an open source python library for natural language procesing. It has modules for collecting, handling and procesing Twitter data.

## Dataset
A twitter dataset that comes with NLTK will be used. This dataset has been manually annotated and serces to establish baselines for models quickly.

The sample dataset from NLTK is separated into positive and negative tweets. It contains 5000 positive tweets and 5000 negative tweets exactly. The exact match between these classes is not a coincidence. The intention is to have a balanced dataset. That does not reflect the real distributions of positive and negative classes in live Twitter streams. It is just because balanced datasets simplify the design of most computational methods that are required for sentiment analysis. However, it is better to be aware that this balance of classes is artificial.
